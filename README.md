Odin Project's Form Assignment

General thoughts: Fairly simple assignment, mostly just practicing CSS and form inputs. I still seem to struggle a bit when it comes to flexbox, but I have definitely improved!

What I learned:

    - how to utilize form inputs (e.g., names, phone numbers, email, password)
    - how to decorate input fields
    - utilizing 'required' in inputs
    - how to add audio controls in html
